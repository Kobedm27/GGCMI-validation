# Main figures
Here all the (sub)figures used in the paper will be stored as .png files with dpi = 300:

- `fig1a_GlobalPeformanceMap`: gridded map of the global, general performance (Rsquared) of the model ensemble median
- `fig1b_LatitudinalScatter`: scatterplot showing all Rsquared values as points along the latitudinal y-axis with GAM-smoothed trend line
- `fig1c_PerformanceTableHAWM`: harvest area weighted mean (HAWM) of all the metrics and variability per model structured in a heatmap plot
