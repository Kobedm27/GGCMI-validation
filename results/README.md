# Results

This folder contains outputs generated by the analysis notebooks in `code/analysis/`.

## Structure

- `main/` — Figures used in the main text 
- `supplementary/` — Figures used as supplementary information

## Notes
- All content is programmatically generated (in R using ggplot2 for plotting).
- The visual theme used to create the figures is inspired by the blog from Cédric Scherer: https://www.cedricscherer.com/
- The HTML files provided in the `code/analysis/` folder can be downloaded and viewed to quickly see for each figure the corresponding code and the rendered plot without having to run the notebook.
- Rerun the corresponding `.qmd` notebook if updates are needed.
