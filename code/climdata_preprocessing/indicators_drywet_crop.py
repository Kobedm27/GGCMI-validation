## COMPUTATION OF DRY AND WET EXTREME CLIMATE INDICATORS

# Define crop name here
crop = "mai"  # options: mai, soy, ri1, ri2, swh, wwh

# This script processes daily precipitation data from the GSWP3-W5E5 dataset to compute 
# annual indicators of wet and dry climate extremes.

# Indicators are calculated:
# - Per calendar year
# - At each grid cell where crops are grown
# - Only using the subset of days within the year when the corresponding crop is grown

# The growing season periods are derived from crop- and land-use-specific calendars.

# These data are further used for the crop specific analysis
# (see code/notebooks/main.qmd) presented in the appendix.

# Output: gridded climate extreme indicators saved to 
# GGCMI-validation/data/processed/extremes_indicators/extremes_indicators/crop_specific/

## 1. Get the precipitation data and join them

pr1 = xr.open_dataset(repo_path / "GGCMI-validation/data/raw/climdata/gswp3-w5e5_obsclim_pr_global_daily_1981_1990.nc", engine='netcdf4')

precip_days = xr.concat([pr1, pr2, pr3, pr4], dim='time')

## 2. Bring in crop data and growing season data 

# Load crop data (earlier processed in R as RData)
cropdat = pyreadr.read_r(repo_path / "GGCMI-validation/data/processed/crop_specific_data.RData")[f"dat_{crop}"]
cropdat_unique = cropdat.drop_duplicates(subset = ["lon", "lat"])

# Load growing seasons
season_firr = xr.open_dataset(repo_path / f"GGCMI-validation/data/raw/other/ggcmi-crop-calendar-phase3_2015soc_{crop}_firr.nc")
season_noirr = xr.open_dataset(repo_path / f"GGCMI-validation/data/raw/other/ggcmi-crop-calendar-phase3_2015soc_{crop}_noirr.nc")

## 3. Define function to calculate longest consecutive wet/dry period 
def extreme_length(array):
    # INPUT:
    # - Array where we want to find maximum length of consecutive dry/wet days
    # OUTPUT:
    # - Maximum length of dry or wet days 

    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    for value in array:
        if value == 1:
            current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 0
    return max_length
	
## 4. Calculate growing season statistics

# The following function will calculate the climate extreme indicators by carefully selecting the growing season days using ISIMIPÂ´s crop calendars
# and regrouping them in "growing season years" which can span 2 calendar years in the Southern Hemisphere. For these growing season days, 
# a threshold climate value is calculated by the 95th/5th percentile. All days above/below this value are considered extremely "wet"/"dry". We count the frequency of 
# wet/days days for each growing season year and location and we also compute the length of the longest consecutive period of wet/dry days for each 
# growing season year and location. 

def season_stat(climate, season_firr_dict, season_noirr_dict, cropdat):
      # INPUT: 
      # - climate: xarray dataset with climate variable

      # - season_noirr: dictionary of full rainfed crop calendar xarray dataset
      # - cropdat: dataframe with locations where <crop> is grown and land use information in terms of irrigation or rainfed. Every row should be a unique location.
