# GGCMI dataframes

This folder contains the restructed R dataframes extracted from the calendar adjusted NetCDF files of the GGCMI yield model runs. 

Each RData file in the folder contains several dataframes for the specific model and crop combination: 
- yld_long_irr: irrigated yields per gridcell
- yld_long_rain: rainfed yields per gridcell
- cntr_prod_irr: national production values for irrigated
- cntr_prod_rain: national production values for rainfed
- cntr_prod: total national production
- area_irr: irrigated crop area per country
- area_rain: rainfed crop area per country
- area: total crop area per country
- yield: total national yields

The rows in the dataframes represent different locations (gridcells or countries), the columns represent different years. 

This folder is structured per crop.
