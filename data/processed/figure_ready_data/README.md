# Figure ready data

 In this folder all the data files ready for the compilation of the figures are stored. The data files are computed for each <crop>, including also the crop-aggregated data (aggr). 

 
The folder contains:
- `extremes_<crop>`: data for analysing performance under climatic extremes (filtered for extremes)
- `general_<crop>`: data for analysing general performance for all gridcell-years (not filtered for extremes, but prefiltered for relevant gridcells). For all crops these contain both simulated (including ensemble median) and benchmark data, for aggr this only contains benchmark data. 
- `general_sim_aggr`: simulation data (including ensemble median) for analyzing general performance.
