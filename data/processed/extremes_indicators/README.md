# Output files of climate extreme indicators computation

This folder contains the output files generated by Python scripts located in `code/scripts/`.

## Overview of data files

from `code/scripts/indicators_drywet_aggr.py` (aggregated crop analysis for main results)
- `FDD_aggr.nc` — Annual frequency of **extreme dry days** (days with precipitation < 0.5th percentile value)
- `FWD_aggr.nc` — Annual frequency of **extreme wet days** (days with precipitation > 95th percentile value)
- `LDS_aggr.nc` — Annual **longest dry spell** (consecutive days with precipitation < 0.5th percentile value)
- `LWS_aggr.nc` — Annual **longest wet spell** (consecutive days with precipitation > 95th percentile value)
- `TPR_aggr.nc` — Annual **Total precipitation** over growing-season days

## Notes

- Indicators are computed only for (crop specific) growing-season days, based on crop calendars and land-use data.
- Only gridcells where at least one of the analyzed crops are grown are included.
- For detailed methodology, see the corresponding scripts in `code/scripts/` and notebooks in `code/notebooks/`.
